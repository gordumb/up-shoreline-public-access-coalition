	title="UP Shoreline Safety"
>
	<p>
		Our coalition would like to heavily emphasize the importance of safety when exploring the shoreline. It's easy
		to under estimate the danger of the water, where things can go bad fast. The Univeristy Place shoreline has a
		unique safety challenge due to the active train tracks that run along it. On this page, we will share some
		brief safety considerations that we hope you will keep in mind and research further as needed since we can't
		include everything here.
	</p>

	<h3>Sea</h3>

	<p>
		There <em>are</em> sharks in the Salish Sea, but none of them are going to eat you. What you should
		<em>really</em> be afraid of is the water itself. The sea is being fed cold water from our rivers and from the
		northern pacific ocean. Even in late summer heat, the water temperature is only a few degrees warmer than it is
		in the winter (that's what powers our temperate climate)! Local lakes will warm up to safe swimming
		temperatures, but the Salish Sea is a <b>serious risk for cold water shock induced drowning and hypothermia
		year round</b>. Unfortunately we see drowning deaths in our state from everyday people jumping in our waterways
		and going into shock. You can enjoy the water safely, just come prepared and practice caution. Shallow water
		can warm up noticeably on a hot day, just always be careful around drown-able water depths. <b>Wearing a life
		jacket is the best way to keep yourself afloat regardless of your condition or situation</b>.
		<br>
		<br>
		The other thing that makes the water a force to be reckoned with is its currents. The further out you go, you
		will face <b>choppy waters</b> and be susceptible to being <b>pulled by the currents</b>. Especially through
		and aroudn the narrows, where so much water moves through such a narrow channel with the tides. You should not
		plan to travel far from shore without a seaworthy vessel and the necessary preparation.
	</p>

	<h3>Trains</h3>

	<p>
		The rail line running along the University Place shoreline is owned by
		<a href="https://bnsfnorthwest.com/washington/">BNSF</a> and gets used frequently. These tracks create an
		access barrier that can be bypassed in any of the following ways:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Walk over the
				<a href="https://www.piercecountywa.gov/1317/Chambers-Creek-Regional-Park">
					Bridge to the Beach
				</a>
				at Chambers Creek Regional Park</li>
			<li>Walk or drive over the Day Island Bridge</li>
			<li>
				Swim/paddle/boat under the famous
				<a href="https://industrialscenery.blogspot.com/2017/06/bnsfnorthern-pacific-bridge-over.html">
					BNSF/Northern Pacific Bridge #14
				</a>
				from Chambers Bay
			</li>
			<li>Walk across the track at the private residential Sunset Beach pedestrian crossing (not public)</li>
			<li>Walk across the track anywhere else (illegal)</li>
		</ul>

		Regardless, please recognize that <b>trains are dangerous</b> and multiple <b>people have been killed</b> by
		trains on this exact train line. <b>Trains can also derail</b>, which has also happened on this exact train
		line!
		<br/>
		<br/>
		A good rule of thumb is to <b>keep your distance and minimize time near the tracks</b>. Walking along the tracks
		is especially risky because you would have to react to oncoming trains and might not have a safe place near you
		at the time.
